# **Text_Summarization**  
### **_Description:_** 
The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing to perform Extractive Summarization of an input file. 

### **_How to use:_**
  - Run the python file and provide the name of the input file/output file 
  - The program will read the input file and create a summary that is piped to the output file.
  
### **_Expansion Possibilities:_**
  - More expansive NLP use 
  - Neural Network 
  - This method can only extract sentences but a method to generate new sentences that summarize would be a great expansion.
